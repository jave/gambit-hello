* gambit hello
some hello world style experiments with the Gambit scheme implementation.
http://gambitscheme.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

Of interest might be some mingw cross-compilation examples.

They were tried on a Fedora 19 host.

You need to cross compile gambit.
./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --enable-single-host
make -j6 #depending on your cores
sudo make install #/usr/local by default

** m3
from the gambit docs. shows how to interface with C
make m3
./m3
** m3-mingw
an attempt att cross compilation using mingw.


** hello
make hello
./hello
print a string and start a REPL
