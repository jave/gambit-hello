* gambit hello
some hello world style experiments with the Gambit scheme implementation.
http://gambitscheme.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

Of interest might be some mingw cross-compilation examples.

** Mingw
They were tried on a Fedora 19 host.

You need to cross compile gambit.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --enable-single-host
  make -j6 #depending on your cores
  sudo make install #/usr/local by default
#+END_SRC

each example has a mingw variant. So, for example:
- make hello, makes the hello example
- make hello-mingw makes an mingw variant of the example

when you run the resulting mingw binary in an xterm, a wineconsole is opened temporarily,
unclear why. The small tst-mingw prog does not do this.

** hello
make hello
./hello
print a string and start a REPL

** m3
from the gambit docs. shows how to interface with C
make m3
./m3



** web-repl
This is code from the gambit examples.
make web-repl
nc 127.0.0.1 7000
